# GridScore Installation

GridScore is a so-called Progressive Web App (PWA), which means that it's basically a website, but on phones and tablets it can be installed to work offline. The mechanism for installing a PWA on your device will vary depending on the operating system. On Android a banner will appear at the bottom of the screen prompting you to install the application. On iOS, press the share icon and then add the app to your home screen.
