The home screen of GridScore shows the three most common options for new users: `Set up a trial`,  `Load example data` and `View introduction tour`. The first will take you to the <a href="trial-setup.html">trial setup screen</a>, while the second loads an exemplar barley dataset that you can explore to see how GridScore works. The last option highlights the main features of GridScore in a step-by-step tour.

If you have used GridScore before, your trials are listed below. Your most recently used dataset is shown first so you can continue where you left off.

The top menu takes you to the data input screen as well as some visualization screens.

The button in the top left toggles the side menu which allows fast and easy switching between your trials.


## Sharing

GridScore can easily share your trial setup as well as all the valuable data you recorded between devices by simply scanning a QR code. Generate a code on device A then scan it on device B and your data has been transfered. Simple as that.

This feature also allows you to set up your trial in the comfort of your office where you can simply copy and paste information into GridScore and then share your trial to a mobile device for when you go out into the field. When you get back, simply share it back to have all your data on your PC.
